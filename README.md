#First web page project

<a target="_blank" href="https://biandresen.github.io/odin-recipes/">Live server</a>

This project will show my skills in creating a new repository on GitHub, 
clone it to my local PC, make a basic website about recipes using a few 
HTML-elements, attributes and values I've recently learned. During the 
build of this site I will also focus on folder management and git commits.
